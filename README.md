# tipsy-cube
A Tipsy Cube intro by Bitshifters & Slipstream.
Released for the FieldFX 2022 New Years Demostream.

This demo requires 2Mb RAM and an ARM250. No warranty is supplied for
running on an 8MHz machine - it is likely to be a stuttery mess, sorry!

Run on real Archimedes hardware with RISC OS 3.1 or 2, or if running
under emulation, use Arculator v2.1+. For best emulated experience,
emulate an A3010 and select sound output filter -> more reduced.

For best audio quality on real Archimedes hardware we recommend
removing the hardware low-pass filter by following the instructions
on this [thread](http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13630).
